# React patterns

Background knowledge consulted while implementing or reviewing React code: web components, Next.js App Router files, and React Native screens built with Expo. Each rule is written so a reviewer can check it against a diff. Rules marked as a preference are house style, not React rules. Language-level TypeScript rules (compiler flags, `unknown` over `any`, discriminated unions, promise handling including `onClick={async ...}`, schema validation, OpenAPI code generation, lint presets) are in `typescript-idioms`; the Vue counterpart of this skill is `vue-patterns`. This skill does not repeat either.

## 1. State

- Keep a value in state only when it changes over time, does not arrive as a prop, and cannot be computed from other state or props. Everything else is a plain expression in render.
- Put state in the component that uses it. Lift it to the closest common parent only when a second component reads it, and pass the setter down as a callback. Colocation removes the re-renders that `memo` would otherwise have to suppress.
- Keep search, filter, and form state in the component or its hook unless another part of the app reads it. A store is not the default location.
- Group values that change together into one object. Replace booleans that can contradict each other (`isLoading`, `isError`, `isSuccess`) with a status union.
- Store the id of a selected item, not a copy of the item. The copy goes stale when the list changes.
- Do not mirror a prop into state. When the prop is only a starting value, name it `initialX` or `defaultX` so the contract is visible.
- Do not put server data in `useState`. Server state (anything fetched, cached, and owned by the backend) lives in a query library; the client state that remains is small.
- Reach for context late: lift first, use context for values many distant components read, and an external store last. Several small providers placed near their readers, not one provider at the root.
- Feature flags come from the flag mechanism; the rules are in `typescript-idioms`. A flag value copied into the client needs a release to change and is invisible to everyone else. The flag response can carry more than a boolean (a list of enabled users, a variant name).

```tsx
// BAD
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false);
const [selected, setSelected] = useState<Company | null>(null);

// GOOD
type Status = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';
const [status, setStatus] = useState<Status>('idle');
const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState<Company['id'] | null>(null);
const selected = companies.find((c) => c.id === selectedId) ?? null;
```

## 2. Effects

An effect synchronises the component with something outside React (a subscription, a DOM library, analytics). Ask of every `useEffect` whether the code runs because the component was displayed or because something specific happened. Only the first is an effect; the second is an event handler.

Things that are not effects:

- Deriving data from props or state. Compute it in render. When the computation is measurably expensive and the compiler is not on, `useMemo`.
- Resetting state when a prop changes. Give the component a `key` from the parent so React remounts it.
- Adjusting state when a prop changes. Compare against the previous value during render (rare), or restructure so the value is derived.
- A request or mutation the user triggered (a POST on submit). It belongs in the handler.
- A chain of effects where each sets state that triggers the next. Compute the whole update in one handler.
- Notifying a parent or passing data up. Call the callback in the handler that changed the state; let the parent own the state when both need it.
- App initialisation that must run once. Guard it at module scope, not with an empty dependency array.
- Subscribing to an external store. `useSyncExternalStore`.

Rules for the effects that remain:

- Every reactive value read inside the effect is a dependency. Never suppress the lint rule; when a dependency is unwanted, change the code so it is not needed (move the object or function inside the effect, or use `useEffectEvent`).
- Cleanup undoes what setup did: unsubscribe, abort, disconnect. Strict Mode runs setup, cleanup, setup in development to expose a missing cleanup.
- A fetch in an effect needs an `ignore` flag (or an `AbortController`) set in cleanup so a slow earlier response cannot overwrite a later one. Prefer the framework loader or the query library over a hand-written fetch effect.
- Read the latest props or state without re-running the effect through `useEffectEvent` (stable in React 19.2, requires the current lint plugin). Do not stash a handler in a ref to get the same result.
- No `useMount`, `useEffectOnce`, or `useUpdateEffect` wrappers. They hide dependencies from the lint rule and from the reader.

```tsx
// BAD
useEffect(() => { setFullName(`${first} ${last}`); }, [first, last]);
useEffect(() => { setComment(''); }, [userId]);

// GOOD
const fullName = `${first} ${last}`;
<Profile userId={userId} key={userId} />
```

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  let ignore = false;
  void loadResults(query).then((results) => {
    if (!ignore) setResults(results);
  });
  return () => { ignore = true; };
}, [query]);
```

## 3. Rules of React and hooks

- Components and hooks are pure: same props and state, same output, no side effects during render. Side effects happen in handlers and effects.
- Props, state, hook arguments, and hook return values are immutable. Do not mutate a value after passing it to JSX or a hook; create a new object.
- Never call a component as a function (`Row(props)`); render it (`<Row {...props} />`). Never define a component inside another component's body; it remounts on every render.
- Call hooks only at the top level of a component or another hook, never in conditions, loops, or nested functions. `use` is the one exception (section 4).
- A function is named `useX` when and only when it calls hooks. A helper without hooks is a plain function.
- Hooks share logic, not state. Two components calling `useFilter()` get two independent states; when they need one, lift it.
- Name a hook for its purpose (`useCompanySearch`, `useChatRoom`), not for its mechanism (`useAsync`, `useData`).
- Turn on Strict Mode and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` with `rules-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps` as errors. Version 6 adds compiler-derived rules (`set-state-in-effect`, `set-state-in-render`, `refs`, `purity`, `immutability`, `static-components`, `error-boundaries`, `preserve-manual-memoization`). The plugin reference lists them under `recommended`; the React 19.2 release notes call them opt-in. Check which rules the installed version's `recommended` config turns on, and enable the compiler-derived set explicitly when it does not.

## 4. React 19 and the compiler

- `ref` is a prop on function components. New code does not use `forwardRef`; flag it in a diff.
- A ref callback returns nothing or a cleanup function. An implicit arrow return (`ref={(el) => (nodes[id] = el)}`) is a type error under React 19; use a block body.
- Render a context as `<ThemeContext value={theme}>`; `.Provider` is the legacy spelling.
- A mutation that tracks pending and error state uses `useActionState` with `<form action>`, and `useFormStatus` inside the form for the pending flag, instead of hand-rolled `isPending` and `error` state around `fetch`. `useOptimistic` shows the expected result while the action runs and reverts on failure.
- `use(promise)` reads a promise under `<Suspense>`. The promise is created outside render (passed from a Server Component or cached); a promise created in render is recreated every render and never settles for React. Errors surface through the nearest error boundary, not a `try`/`catch` around `use`. Unlike other hooks, `use` can be called conditionally. Do not read `promise.status` yourself.
- Register `onCaughtError` and `onUncaughtError` on `createRoot` so render errors reach the error tracker.

Memoisation under the compiler:

- New code does not add `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `memo`. The compiler memoises; a manual call is justified only for precise control, such as keeping an effect dependency stable, and says so in a comment.
- Existing memoisation stays. The compiler documentation says removing it can change compilation output and asks for a test or measurement before removal; the pre-compiler guidance still presents `useMemo` as the tool for an expensive derivation. In a diff, check that a removed `useMemo` or `memo` comes with a measurement or a test, and that an added one names the reason.
- A component the compiler must skip (an incompatible library, a deliberate impurity) carries `"use no memo"` at the top of the function with the reason next to it.

```tsx
// BAD
const Input = forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, Props>((props, ref) => <input ref={ref} {...props} />);
<div ref={(el) => (nodes.current[id] = el)} />
<ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>

// GOOD
function Input({ ref, ...props }: Props & { ref?: Ref<HTMLInputElement> }) {
  return <input ref={ref} {...props} />;
}
<div ref={(el) => { nodes.current[id] = el; }} />
<ThemeContext value={theme}>{children}</ThemeContext>
```

```tsx
const [error, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
  async (_previous: string | null, formData: FormData) => {
    const result = await renameCompany(String(formData.get('name')));
    return result.ok ? null : result.message;
  },
  null,
);
```

## 5. Components

- One component has one responsibility. Split a screen or page that fetches, derives, and renders several regions into a component per region, and move data fetching and derived state into hooks in their own files. A screen file that is never split keeps growing.
- Name a component for what it is (`CompanyCard`, `EventList`), not for where it appears or which version it is. A numeric suffix (`CompaniesScreen2`) marks an unfinished migration; plan its removal when the old one goes.
- Pass the whole domain object as a prop (`company={company}`), not an id plus a name plus a status that must stay in sync at every call site.
- Model a domain concept as an object with predicate methods (`contract.isFreePlan()`, `event.hasStarted()`) rather than free helper functions scattered across components. The predicate lives once and is tested once.
- Preference: name a boolean prop for the capability the caller sees (`isCancelable`), not for the implementation detail (`showCancelButton`).
- Pass call-site-dependent values (tracking parameters, labels, destinations) in from the caller. A shared component that branches on where it was rendered grows one branch per call site.
- A callback prop fires on the event it names. `onScrollEnd` fires once when the end is reached, not on every scroll event.
- When new code duplicates logic that exists elsewhere (a remaining-time calculation, a formatter), share it, in the same PR or a named follow-up.
- Name a configuration constant so its value cannot be misread: `SESSION_SAMPLING_PERCENT = 1`, not `SESSION_SAMPLING_RATE = 1` with a comment saying it means one percent.
- A constant sent verbatim to analytics is data other people filter on. Renaming it breaks their dashboards; tell the consumers in the PR.
- `console.warn` or `console.error` in a shipped app is not error handling; nobody reads it. Route the error to the error tracker, or write down what the log achieves.
- Error boundaries catch render errors only, not handler errors, async errors, or server-side errors (errors inside `startTransition` are caught). Place one where a meaningful fallback exists (a widget, a route), not around every leaf.

```tsx
// BAD
<CompanyCard companyId={company.id} companyName={company.name} isPremium={company.plan === 'premium'} />
<ConfirmDialog showCancelButton onConfirm={submit} />

// GOOD
<CompanyCard company={company} />
<ConfirmDialog isCancelable onConfirm={submit} />
```

## 6. Server state and stores

Server state in a query library (TanStack Query):

- The query key is the dependency array of the `queryFn`: every value the function reads is in the key, so a change refetches and two callers with the same inputs share one cache entry.
- One custom hook per query (`useCompany(id)`), so key, function, and options live in one place. A dependent query uses `enabled`, not a conditional hook call.
- Set `staleTime` deliberately. The default is zero, which refetches on every mount, focus, and reconnect; permissions and feature flags take `'static'` or a long value.
- Do not copy query data into `useState`. Read it from the hook. The one exception is initial form values, named as such.
- `setQueryData` is for optimistic updates only; other writes go through a mutation and invalidation.
- Preference: do not add defensive parsing for a fixed-format value your own backend returns under a generated type. The type already states the shape; a schema is for input you do not control.

```tsx
function useCompany(id: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['company', id],
    queryFn: () => fetchCompany(id),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  });
}
```

Client stores:

- Zustand: select atomic slices (`useStore((s) => s.count)`). Selecting the whole store re-renders the component on every change. Use `useShallow` when a selector returns an object or array. Actions live inside the store, next to the state they change.
- Jotai fits when atoms replace `useState` plus context pairs, when state must split with the code that uses it, or when a Suspense-based async value is wanted; Zustand fits one module-level store with actions. Define atoms at module scope so their identity is stable.
- Preference: when a directory follows a library idiom whose name collides with a project term (`src/atoms` for Jotai atoms next to atomic-design components), add a one-line comment saying which meaning applies.

```tsx
// BAD
const { items, open } = useCartStore();

// GOOD
const count = useCartStore((s) => s.items.length);
const { open, close } = useCartStore(useShallow((s) => ({ open: s.open, close: s.close })));
```

## 7. Next.js App Router

- Components are Server Components by default. Add `'use client'` only at the interactive leaves (state, handlers, effects, browser APIs). Every module a client module imports becomes client code, so the directive sits as low in the tree as possible.
- A Server Component can be passed into a Client Component as `children` or a prop. A context provider is a Client Component that wraps `children`, rendered as deep as it can be.
- Props that cross the server-to-client boundary are serialisable: no functions, class instances, or whole database records.
- `import 'server-only'` at the top of a module that reads secrets or the database, so a client import fails at build time. Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables reach the client, and only the data access layer reads `process.env`. The data access layer returns DTOs shaped for the UI, not ORM rows.
- `fetch` is not cached by default. Use `'use cache'` for data that can be shared, `<Suspense>` close to the uncached data for streaming (finer than a route-level `loading.js`), and `React.cache` around ORM calls that repeat within one request.
- Start independent requests before awaiting any of them (`Promise.all`, or a preload call) instead of one `await` after another.
- Every Server Action is a public POST endpoint. It authenticates and authorises inside its own body; a check on the page that renders the form is not a boundary. It validates `FormData` and parameters with a schema, accepts ids and loads the records itself (schema validation checks shape, not ownership), returns only what the UI needs, and calls `revalidatePath` or `updateTag` before `redirect`, which throws.
- The client dispatches actions one at a time; `Promise.all` over several actions runs them sequentially anyway.

```tsx
'use server';
export async function archiveCompany(companyId: string) {
  const user = await requireUser();
  const company = await findOwnedCompany(companyId, user.id);
  if (!company) notFound();
  await archive(company.id);
  revalidatePath('/companies');
  redirect('/companies');
}
```

## 8. React Native and Expo

- New projects use Expo Router: file-based routes under `app/`, `_layout` files, typed routes, deep links generated from the file tree.
- The New Architecture is the default since React Native 0.76 and Expo SDK 52 and mandatory from SDK 55. A dependency without New Architecture support blocks the upgrade; check it with `npx expo-doctor` and the React Native directory before adding it. Synchronous measurement goes in `useLayoutEffect`.
- Long lists use `FlatList` (with `getItemLayout` when row heights are known) or a virtualised list library, never `ScrollView` with `map`.
- Animations run on the native thread (`useNativeDriver: true`, or a native-thread animation library) and animate `transform` and `opacity`, not `width` or `height`, which trigger layout.
- Measure performance in a release build; a development build measures the developer tooling. Strip `console.log` from release builds. Heavy work in `onPress` goes behind `requestAnimationFrame` so the touch feedback renders first.
- Changes with a wide blast radius get a real-device check before merge, on every path and not only the happy one: native build configuration (the Podfile, Gradle files, config plugins), login and post-login flows, and the crash-reporting integration (send a test event and confirm it arrives). Temporarily changing a staging response is a fair way to exercise a path such as a forced-update screen.
- Changing the minimum supported OS version drops users. It is a product decision; confirm it with the product owner before merging.
- The web sections apply unchanged: state, effects, hooks, query library, stores.

```tsx
// BAD
<ScrollView>{events.map((event) => <EventRow key={event.id} event={event} />)}</ScrollView>

// GOOD
<FlatList
  data={events}
  keyExtractor={(event) => event.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <EventRow event={item} />}
/>
```

## 9. Testing UI code

- A test resembles how the software is used: it renders the component and interacts through the DOM (React Testing Library) or the native element tree (React Native Testing Library), not through component instances or implementation details. No shallow rendering.
- Query in this order: `getByRole` (with `name`), `getByLabelText`, `getByPlaceholderText`, `getByText`, `getByDisplayValue`, `getByAltText`, `getByTitle`, and `getByTestId` last. Use `screen`, and never `container.querySelector`.
- Interact with `userEvent.setup()`, not `fireEvent`; it dispatches the full sequence of events a user produces.
- Wait with `await screen.findBy...`, not `waitFor(() => getBy...)`. `queryBy*` is only for asserting absence. No side effects or several assertions inside `waitFor`, and no manual `act`.
- Unit-test hooks with `renderHook` and pure logic (predicates, formatters, reducers) directly; that is where the edge cases live and the tests are cheap. Most other tests are integration tests of a component with its children and minimal mocking.
- Critical flows get a Playwright test: role or text locators, never CSS or XPath; web-first assertions (`await expect(locator).toBeVisible()`), never an un-awaited `isVisible()`; third-party services mocked; traces kept on CI.
- A jsdom test proves behaviour in a simulated browser; a browser-mode test or an end-to-end test proves it in a real one. Neither replaces the other.

```tsx
// BAD
fireEvent.click(container.querySelector('.save')!);
await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByText('Saved')).toBeInTheDocument());

// GOOD
const user = userEvent.setup();
await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' }));
expect(await screen.findByText('Saved')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

## 10. Accessibility

- Use the native element before ARIA: `<button>`, `<a href>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<dialog>`. Do not change a native element's semantics with `role`. No ARIA is better than bad ARIA.
- Every control has a label: `<label htmlFor>` paired through `useId()`, or `aria-label` when a visible label is impossible. A placeholder is not a label.
- A `<button>` for an action, an `<a>` for navigation. A `div` with `onClick` is neither, and the keyboard cannot reach it. Give every `<button>` a `type`.
- Every interactive element is keyboard-operable: reachable by Tab, activated by Enter or Space, dismissible by Escape when it is a dialog or menu. A custom widget with an ARIA role promises the keyboard behaviour of that role.
- Never `aria-hidden` or `role="presentation"` on a focusable element. Hide visually with CSS instead.
- Headings descend in order without skipping levels; landmarks (`main`, `nav`) mark the page regions.
- Write `aria-*` attributes as in HTML (`aria-describedby`, not `ariaDescribedBy`).
- In React Native, set `accessibilityRole`, `accessibilityLabel`, and `accessibilityState` on `Pressable` and image elements so the screen reader announces what the control does.

```tsx
function EmailField() {
  const id = useId();
  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={id}>Email</label>
      <input id={id} type="email" autoComplete="email" />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Is every `useState` a value that changes over time, is not a prop, and cannot be computed? Are contradictory booleans a status union, and selections stored as ids?
- [ ] Is state kept in the component that uses it, with server data in the query library and no query data copied into state?
- [ ] Does any `useEffect` derive data, reset state on a prop change, run a user-triggered request, chain into another effect, or notify a parent?
- [ ] Does every effect list its reactive values, clean up what it set up, and guard fetches with an `ignore` flag or `AbortController`? Is any lint rule suppressed?
- [ ] Are hooks at top level, named `useX` only when they call hooks, and named for purpose rather than mechanism?
- [ ] Does the diff add `forwardRef`, `.Provider`, an implicit-return ref callback, or hand-rolled pending state where `useActionState` fits?
- [ ] Is every new `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `memo` justified in a comment, and every removed one backed by a test or measurement?
- [ ] Is each component one responsibility, named for what it is, given the whole domain object, and free of branches on its call site?
- [ ] Is a feature flag, allowlist, or rollout percentage hard-coded in the client?
- [ ] Is a runtime error logged with `console.warn` instead of reaching the error tracker?
- [ ] Does every query hook include all inputs in its key and set `staleTime` deliberately? Does any Zustand selector return the whole store?
- [ ] Is `'use client'` at the leaves, are boundary props serialisable, and does every Server Action authenticate, authorise, validate, and accept ids inside its body?
- [ ] Does a long list use `ScrollView`, does an animation touch `width` or `height`, and was a native-config, login, or crash-reporting change checked on a real device?
- [ ] Do tests query by role or label, use `userEvent`, and `await findBy*` instead of `waitFor(getBy*)`?
- [ ] Does every control have a label, every action a `<button>`, every navigation an `<a>`, and is every interactive element reachable by keyboard?
