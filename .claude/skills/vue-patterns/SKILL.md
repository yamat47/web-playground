# Vue patterns

Background knowledge consulted while implementing or reviewing Vue 3 code. Each rule is written so a reviewer can check it against a diff. Rules marked as a preference are house style, not Vue rules. Language-level TypeScript (compiler flags, `unknown` over `any`, discriminated unions, the promise rules that also cover `@click` on an async function, schema validation, OpenAPI code generation) is in `typescript-idioms`; the React versions of the framework rules are in `react-patterns`. Neither is repeated here.

## 1. Components

- Give every component a multi-word PascalCase name (`TodoItem`, not `Todo`) so it can never collide with a current or future HTML element. Declare props in camelCase and write them in kebab-case in templates.
- One component per file, and the file is named for what the component is. A footer block is not `FooterPage.vue`; a component that renders one variant carries the variant in its name.
- Declare props with a type-based `defineProps<Props>()` that states the element type of every array and the shape of every object. A bare `Array` or `Object` tells the reader nothing.
- Put a `:key` on every `v-for`. The key is stable and unique among siblings: an id, never an index or a measured value such as a height.
- Never put `v-if` and `v-for` on the same element. Filter in a `computed` or wrap the element in `<template v-for>`.
- Scope styles with `<style scoped>` or CSS modules in every component except the root. Even then, give class names that are specific to the component (`event-related-link`, not `link`); `:deep` selectors and global styles cross the boundary.
- Split a component that has grown past one screen by single responsibility. A loosely coupled part such as an input with suggestion search becomes its own component that emits events. A root component that has collected page-level concerns (metadata, tracking) is decomposed the same way.
- A component never inspects its caller's context to decide its own behaviour: no `route.path === '/candidates'` inside a summary component. Pass the fact as a prop, or let the injection expose whether a value was provided. The callee knowing the caller is the wrong direction of dependency.
- Pass the whole domain object as a prop, not an id plus a name that must stay in sync. Separate props let a caller pass a mismatched pair; one object cannot.
- Preference: a reusable component takes whole display strings as props rather than interpolating a fragment into a fixed phrase inside the component. Decide how generic the component is before writing it.
- A boolean prop that hides part of the component (`showRelatedLinks`) exists only when a caller uses the hiding path. Delete the prop otherwise; each optional branch is code to maintain.
- Preference: when one component serves two modes with branches throughout (`mode === 'weekly'`), split it into one component per mode, or introduce a more abstract component that takes the mode. A parent that knows "in this mode show this" knows too much about the child. The same test applies before sharing a component across variants: every variant-specific branch multiplies what has to be verified.
- When sibling elements must share one style, define it once as a component or a class instead of repeating the same props on each element; repetition lets one sibling drift.
- Keep template expressions simple and move logic into `computed`. Pass a constant string as a plain attribute (`page-type="list"`), not a bound expression (`:page-type="'list'"`).
- Preference: state lives in script and appearance lives in CSS. Toggle a class (`:class="{ 'is-opened': opened }"`) rather than computing colours or borders in a `:style` object, use classes for static styling, and take colours from the design tokens rather than raw hex values.
- Preference: bind declaratively rather than driving the DOM imperatively. `querySelectorAll('.editor > h2')` against a library's markup is fragile; when it cannot be avoided, wrap the library in one module, and cover that module with unit tests so an upgrade does not need manual verification.

```vue
<!-- BAD -->
<li v-for="item in items" v-if="item.active" :key="item.id">{{ item.name }}</li>

<!-- GOOD -->
<script setup lang="ts">
const activeItems = computed(() => items.value.filter((item) => item.active))
</script>
<template>
  <li v-for="item in activeItems" :key="item.id">{{ item.name }}</li>
</template>
```

```ts
// BAD
const props = defineProps<{ categoryId: number; categoryName: string }>()

// GOOD
const props = defineProps<{ category: Category }>()
```

## 2. Props, emits, and models

- Data flows one way. Never assign to a prop or mutate a nested object inside one; `vue/no-mutating-props` catches the first, review catches the second. A prop used as an initial value is copied into a local `ref`; a prop that needs transforming goes through a `computed`; a change the parent must know about is emitted.
- Declare props either type-based or at runtime, not both. Give defaults with reactive props destructure (`const { label = 'Total' } = defineProps<Props>()`) in Vue 3.5, or `withDefaults` on older versions, with a factory function for an object or array default.
- Destructure `props` only on Vue 3.5 or later, where the transform is on by default; before that the destructured value is a snapshot (`vue/no-setup-props-reactivity-loss`). When a destructured prop goes to `watch` or into a composable, pass a getter (`() => count`); a destructured prop passed by value is a plain value, not a reactive source.
- Type emits with the named tuple syntax and declare every event the component emits (`vue/require-explicit-emits`). An undeclared event falls through to the root element as a native listener.
- Use `defineModel()` for `v-model`. Do not combine `defineModel({ default })` with a parent that may pass `undefined`: the child shows the default while the parent holds `undefined`, and the two disagree until the first change.
- Preference: selection state belongs to the parent. An option or item component does not know the currently selected value, the way an `<option>` does not know its `<select>`.
- Preference: name a boolean prop or CSS state class as a state (`opened`, `is-opened`), not an action (`open`); name a boolean by the meaning it carries (`hasMoreItems`), not by the widget that reads it (`isShowMoreButton`); name a handler as noun plus intransitive verb (`onTitleChange`, not `onChangeTitle`).
- Use props and events, never `$parent` or a shared mutable object, to talk between parent and child.

```ts
const { count, label = 'Total' } = defineProps<{ count: number; label?: string }>()
const emit = defineEmits<{ change: [id: number]; close: [] }>()
const query = defineModel<string>({ required: true })

// BAD: passes a snapshot
useCounterLabel(count)
// GOOD: passes a reactive source
useCounterLabel(() => count)
```

## 3. Reactivity

- `computed` holds every derived value. Its getter is pure: no request, no assignment, no DOM access, and nothing ever assigns to the result (`vue/no-side-effects-in-computed-properties`, `vue/no-async-in-computed-properties`).
- `watch` and `watchEffect` exist for side effects: a request, storage, a third-party call, a DOM measurement. Vue sanctions watchers for this; a watcher is not a smell by itself, only a watcher that computes a value another `computed` could hold. `watch` names its sources and runs lazily; `watchEffect` tracks what it reads and runs at once.
- Read the DOM after an update with `flush: 'post'`. Avoid `flush: 'sync'` on a source that changes often.
- A watcher that starts async work registers cleanup with `onWatcherCleanup` (3.5) or the `onCleanup` argument, so a stale response never overwrites a newer one.
- `deep: true` walks the whole structure on every change; on a large object use `deep: 1` or watch the specific property. Watching a `reactive()` object is deep by default.
- Register lifecycle hooks and watchers synchronously at the top level of `setup` (`vue/no-lifecycle-after-await`, `vue/no-watch-after-await`). A hook registered inside a callback or event handler binds to no instance and runs never or leaks.
- In script, a `ref` is read and written through `.value`; only the template unwraps top-level refs. After a migration or a large refactor, search for refs compared or passed without `.value`.
- Hold large immutable data (a fetched list, a parsed document) in `shallowRef` and replace the whole value; deep reactivity on ten thousand nodes costs more than it returns.
- Keep list item props stable: pass `:active="item.id === activeId"` rather than `activeId` to every item, so only two items re-render when the selection moves.
- Reference template elements with `useTemplateRef<HTMLInputElement>('input')` (3.5). Do not pass a generic argument to `reactive()`; annotate the variable instead.
- Load rarely shown components with `defineAsyncComponent` or lazy routes and virtualise long lists before reaching for `v-memo` or `v-once`.

```ts
const results = shallowRef<Result[]>([])
watch(query, async (next) => {
  const controller = new AbortController()
  onWatcherCleanup(() => controller.abort())
  results.value = await search(next, { signal: controller.signal })
})

const input = useTemplateRef<HTMLInputElement>('input')
onMounted(() => input.value?.focus())
```

## 4. Composables

- Name a composable `useXxx`. Accept `MaybeRefOrGetter<T>` and read it with `toValue()` inside `computed`, `watch`, or `watchEffect` so the dependency is tracked. Return a plain object of refs, never a `reactive()` object, so the caller can destructure without losing reactivity.
- Browser and DOM work happens in `onMounted`, and its teardown in `onUnmounted`, inside the composable that owns the resource (an event listener, an observer). This keeps the composable safe under SSR.
- Preference: a composable that loads data defines `load` and returns it; the component decides when to call it (`onMounted(load)` in the page, not inside the composable). Invocation timing is the caller's decision.
- Prefer composables to mixins. A mixin hides where a property comes from and collides on names. Reach for a component instead only when layout is shared as well.
- Organise `setup` by logical concern (search, pagination, selection), each concern one composable or one contiguous block, not by primitive type (all refs, then all computeds).
- Preference: model a domain concept as an object that answers questions about itself (`contract.targetYearRequired`, `contract.eventAvailable`) instead of free-standing helpers (`isEventAvailable(type, subType)`) or checks inside components. Script-like predicate functions multiply and put dependencies in the wrong place; a domain object is reusable from any component or store. Watch for a page component that has become a long procedural script and split it into such objects before it grows further.
- Reuse the shared conversion or helper that already exists before writing the mapping inline in a component; two copies drift.
- Preference: guard a permission-dependent fetch at the call site so the call is never made, rather than returning early inside the fetch function. A caller that asks for what it may not have is the problem.

```ts
export function useFullName(user: MaybeRefOrGetter<User>) {
  const fullName = computed(() => {
    const { firstName, lastName } = toValue(user)
    return `${firstName} ${lastName}`
  })
  return { fullName }
}

// GOOD: the page decides when to load
const { todos, load } = useTodos()
onMounted(load)
```

## 5. State

- State is local until a second reader appears. Search and form state live in a `ref` or a composable in the component that owns the form; a store-backed `searchQuery` that no other view reads is surface area without a reader, and chaining the value up through several emitted events is worse. Move state to a store when several views depend on it or when it would otherwise be drilled through many layers.
- Do not place a value used by one component in a store.
- For a deep subtree, use `provide` and `inject` with a `Symbol() as InjectionKey<T>` key. Mutations stay in the provider: provide a `readonly()` view and the functions that change it. `inject` returns `T | undefined` unless a default is given; handle that.
- Pinia stores are setup stores named `useXxxStore`. Never destructure a store directly; take state and getters through `storeToRefs` and destructure actions freely. A store does not return the route or other app-provided values.
- Under SSR, never create shared state at module scope (`const cart = ref([])` in a `.ts` module); one request's data leaks into the next. Use a store, or in Nuxt `useState`.
- Per-user rollout goes through the feature-flag mechanism; the rules are in `typescript-idioms`. A stub that always returns `false` says in its comment that a flag will replace it.

```ts
export const themeKey = Symbol() as InjectionKey<Readonly<Ref<Theme>>>
provide(themeKey, readonly(theme))

export const useCartStore = defineStore('cart', () => {
  const items = ref<Item[]>([])
  const total = computed(() => items.value.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price, 0))
  function add(item: Item) { items.value.push(item) }
  return { items, total, add }
})
const { items, total } = storeToRefs(useCartStore())
const { add } = useCartStore()
```

```ts
// BAD
const canSearch = userId % 20 === 2 || [12, 48, 301].includes(userId)

// GOOD
const canSearch = flags.isEnabled('free-word-search', { defaultValue: false })
```

## 6. Nuxt 4

- Application code lives under `app/`. `components/`, `composables/`, and `utils/` are auto-imported; a name that already exists there is a collision, not a new export. Import explicitly from `#imports` when the source must be visible, and set `imports.scan` to false to turn scanning off for a directory.
- Never call `$fetch` at the top level of `setup`; it runs on the server and again during hydration. Use `useFetch` for a URL and `useAsyncData` for any other async source. `$fetch` belongs in event handlers and other code that runs on one side only.
- Two calls with the same key share `data`, `error`, and `status`, so they must pass the same `handler`, `transform`, `pick`, `default`, and `deep`. `data` is a `shallowRef` that defaults to `undefined` (pass `deep: true` to opt in). `lazy: true` means the component renders before the data arrives and must handle the loading state itself.
- Pass a getter or `computed` for a reactive URL so the request re-runs when the source changes. Do not use `useAsyncData` for a side effect such as calling a store action.
- Shared state that must survive server rendering goes in `useState('key')`, which is serialised and shallow; wrap it in a composable so the key is written once.

```ts
// BAD
const user = await $fetch('/api/user')

// GOOD
const { data: user } = await useFetch('/api/user')
const { data: posts } = await useFetch(() => `/api/users/${userId.value}/posts`)
```

## 7. Errors

- `app.config.errorHandler` receives every uncaught error from components, watchers, and handlers; it is the place to report to a tracker.
- `onErrorCaptured` in an ancestor catches errors from descendants' render, setup, lifecycle hooks, watchers, and event handlers, including a rejected promise returned from a handler. It does not see a `setTimeout` callback or a promise nobody returned. Return `false` to stop propagation, render a fallback, and do not re-render the content that failed.

```ts
const failed = ref(false)
onErrorCaptured((err, _instance, info) => {
  report(err, info)
  failed.value = true
  return false
})
```

## 8. Testing UI code

- Test what the user sees and does. With Vue Testing Library, query by role first (`getByRole('button', { name: 'Search' })`), then label text, then visible text; `getByTestId` is the last resort, and `wrapper.vm` internals from Vue Test Utils are not what a user interacts with.
- Drive the component with `user-event`, not `fireEvent` or `wrapper.trigger`, so focus, keyboard, and pointer sequences match a browser.
- Wait with `findBy*` (`await screen.findByText('3 results')`), never `waitFor(() => getBy...)`, and use `queryBy*` only to assert absence. A `waitFor` block holds one assertion and no side effect.
- Unit-test composables and domain objects directly with Vitest; a composable that uses lifecycle hooks is mounted inside a throwaway component. Behaviour that has needed repeated ad hoc fixes (an image refetched or not) gets a test that pins it.
- Cover critical flows with Playwright: locate by role or text, assert with web-first matchers (`await expect(locator).toBeVisible()`), never branch on an un-awaited `isVisible()`, and mock third parties.
- Vitest with jsdom or happy-dom simulates a browser; treat a layout or focus result as unverified until a browser-mode or Playwright test has seen it.

## 9. Accessibility

- Use the native element before adding ARIA: `<button>` for an action, `<a href>` for navigation, `<input>` with its `type`. A `<div @click>` has no role, no keyboard handling, and no focus. Do not change a native element's semantics with `role`.
- Every control has a label: `<label :for>` paired with the input's `id` (generate the id with `useId()` in 3.5). A placeholder is not a label.
- Every `<button>` in a form declares `type` so a non-submit button does not submit.
- Anything that responds to a click responds to Enter or Space and is reachable with Tab. A `role` added to an element is a promise to implement its keyboard behaviour.
- Never put `aria-hidden` or `role="presentation"` on a focusable element.
- Headings run in order without skipping levels; landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`) replace `<div class="main">`.
- An external link opened in a new tab carries `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, both words.

```vue
<!-- BAD -->
<div @click="save">Save</div>
<input placeholder="Email" v-model="email" />

<!-- GOOD -->
<button type="button" @click="save">Save</button>
<label :for="emailId">Email</label>
<input :id="emailId" type="email" v-model="email" />
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Is every component multi-word, one per file, named for what it is, with a `:key` on each `v-for` that is unique and stable, and no `v-if` sharing an element with `v-for`?
- [ ] Are props typed to their element and object shapes, and does any component take an id plus a name where the whole domain object would do?
- [ ] Does any component read its caller's context (route, parent) or branch on a mode throughout instead of being split?
- [ ] Is any prop mutated, or any destructured prop passed to `watch` or a composable by value instead of as a getter?
- [ ] Is every emitted event declared, and does any `defineModel({ default })` face a parent that can pass `undefined`?
- [ ] Does a `computed` perform a side effect, or does a watcher compute a value a `computed` should hold?
- [ ] Does a watcher that starts async work register cleanup, and are hooks and watchers registered synchronously in `setup`?
- [ ] Is a `ref` read without `.value` in script, or a large immutable structure held in a deep `ref`?
- [ ] Does a composable accept `MaybeRefOrGetter`, read it through `toValue`, return plain refs, and leave `onMounted(load)` to the caller?
- [ ] Is a domain question answered by a free helper or an inline check where an object with a predicate belongs?
- [ ] Is search or form state in a store or relayed through emitted events when a local composable would do, and is any store destructured without `storeToRefs`?
- [ ] Is shared state created at module scope in an SSR app, or a rollout decided by a hard-coded id list or modulo?
- [ ] Does any Nuxt `setup` call `$fetch` at the top level, reuse a `useFetch` key with different options, or pass a static URL where a getter is needed?
- [ ] Do the tests query by role or label, use `user-event` and `findBy*`, and cover composables and library-dependent code directly?
- [ ] Does every action use a `<button>` with a `type`, every navigation an `<a>`, every control a `<label>`, and every new-tab link `noopener noreferrer`?
